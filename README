Tengu GameLib is a small HTML5 game library used in Tengu's HTML5 games that
allows you to easily create and manage game states.


Quick and dirty documentation:

==============

STATE MANAGING
You can easily add a state by doing:
  new State ("name");

This state will now be available from the global STATES variable, like so:
  STATES["name"]

Of course, if you do var a = new State("a"), said state will also be
available in var a.

Resources can now be preloaded into the state by using:
  STATES["name"].loadResources(["path/to/file1.png", "path/to/file2.ogg"]);

You can tell the state what to do in its rendering or updating cycles by
overloading the following two functions:
  STATES["name"].update()
  STATES["name"].render()

The currently running state is also stored in the global STATE variable, which
makes it easy to just access it as follows inside its update or render cycles:
  STATE

To run a state, do:
  STATES["name"].start()

When starting a new state, the previous state is paused, so this is also the
main function used to simply switch between states. When you start() the old
state, it will simply resume where it left off. If you want the state to start
fresh, a STATE.reset() will be implemented in the next version.

==============

RESOURCE MANAGING
When a state requires a resource (like a picture or a sound), this is passed to
the state and the engine will show a "Loading" screen until all resources have
been loaded. Once a resource fails to load, it will load a fallback file in-
stead.

Resources that have been loaded (succesfully or not) can be accessed like this:
  RES["filename"]

Sounds are automatically read from the directory res/snd. Pictures are
(currently) simply read from the res directory and do not support fallback
placeholders yet.

RES["filename"] will return a simple HTML node which you can then give instruc-
tions, so if it's a picture, you can do things like:
  RES["filename.png"].src

==============

INPUT HANDLING

Both the mouse and keyboard are supported. They are accessed through the global
variable INPUT, which consists of the following methods:
  getMouseX()
  getMouseY()
  isMouseButtonPressed(number)
  isKeyPressed(keycode or label as string)

isKeyPressed supports the following labels for the most commonly used keys:
  left right up down space enter shift ctrl control W A S D

isKeyPressed constantly returns true if the key is pressed for each frame the
game is running, so make sure to check for that. Better control over pressing
and releasing keys will probably become available.

If you need direct control over the input event managers instead, they are
available in $(document) for key input and $("#gamecanvas") for mouse input.
