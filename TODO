GameLib Roadmap

0.4:
* Put functions and variables into one global object (to clean up the global namespace).
* Move Canvas creation and initialization into the script.

0.5:
* Implement loading new resources into the currently running state.

0.6:
* Add support for importing other scripts.

Longer term 1.0:
* Fix the resource loading system to respond on each file loaded rather than having some function check several times a second if everything has been loaded.
* Make sure it works across at least Chrome, Firefox and Opera. Preferably also IE9.
* Add complete usage and function documentation!
